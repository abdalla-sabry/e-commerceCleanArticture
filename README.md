Flutter TDD Clean Architecture E-Commerce App - E_commerce
ðŸ“¦ Welcome to the Flutter TDD Clean Architecture E-Commerce App
This repository presents a comprehensive E-Commerce mobile application developed using Flutter 3, following the principles of Clean Architecture, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and the BLoC (Business Logic Component) state management pattern.

The project serves as a practical demonstration of modern mobile app development best practices, aimed at building applications that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient. By combining architectural discipline with Flutterâ€™s UI capabilities, this app highlights how professional-grade mobile solutions can be built using clean, testable, and modular code.

## Key Features:

Test-Driven Development (TDD):
This project emphasizes writing tests before implementing features. It ensures the app's business logic is robust, maintainable, and less prone to regression.

Clean Architecture:
The app adopts a layered architectureâ€”Presentation, Domain, and Dataâ€”to promote separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability.

BLoC State Management:
Utilizing the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, the app achieves a reactive and well-organized state flow, improving code structure and app performance.

Firebase Integration:
Firebase is used for authentication, as well as for storing and managing user data, orders, and other real-time interactions, offering a seamless backend solution.

E-Commerce Functionality:
The application delivers a complete E-Commerce experience: users can browse and search products, add them to the cart, and place orders easily through an intuitive UI.
